 Connecting EC2 to Amazon Aurora

What I Learned
This lab helped me understand how to use Amazon Aurora, a fully managed database service by AWS. I also learned how to securely connect an EC2 instance to a database within the same VPC. By the end of the lab, I was able to query the database from the EC2 instance using the MySQL command-line tool.

 What I Did (Steps Overview)

1. Launched an Amazon Aurora MySQL-compatible DB instance in a VPC
2. Ensured that the DB subnet group and security groups allowed traffic from the EC2 instance
3. Logged into a pre-created Amazon EC2 instance using SSH
4. Installed MySQL client on the EC2 instance (if not already installed)
5. Connected to the Aurora instance using endpoint details
6. Ran SQL queries to test the database connection


Lab Completion  
This lab was completed successfully when I was able to connect to the Amazon Aurora instance from the EC2 instance and run queries using the MySQL client.
