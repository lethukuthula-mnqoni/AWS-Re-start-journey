 AWS Lambda, IAM, and CloudWatch Integration

 Overview

In this lab, I explored how to work with AWS Lambda functions and connect them to other AWS services. I learned how IAM policies control what Lambda can access, how to handle external dependencies using Lambda layers, and how to run and monitor scheduled functions.

Objectives

By completing this lab I was able to

 Understand which IAM policy permissions are needed for Lambda to access other AWS services
 Create and attach a Lambda layer for external library dependencies
 Build Lambda functions that extract data from a database and send reports to a user
 Deploy a Lambda function that is triggered on a schedule and invokes another function
 Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to troubleshoot and monitor Lambda activity

 What I Did 
1. Reviewed and applied IAM policies to give Lambda permissions to access services like Amazon RDS and Amazon SNS
2. Created a Lambda layer to add an external Python library 
3. Wrote a Lambda function that reads from a database and prepares a report
4. Set up a second L
