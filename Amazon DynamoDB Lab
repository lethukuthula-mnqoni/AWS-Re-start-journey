Working with Amazon DynamoDB

 Overview

In this lab, I learned how to use Amazon DynamoDB, which is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS. It is designed for fast and flexible performance with key-value and document data models. I used the AWS Console to create, insert, query, and delete data in a DynamoDB table.

 What I Did 

1. Opened the DynamoDB service in the AWS Console
2. Created a new table with a primary key
3. Used the **Items** tab to insert sample data (key-value pairs)
4. Queried the table by specifying the key to retrieve matching items
5. Deleted the table after finishing the queries

Lab Completion

This lab was successfully completed when I was able to:
- Create a working DynamoDB table
- Enter and query data using the AWS Console
- Delete the table
