 Creating an S3 bucket

 What I Learned
In this lab, I learned how to create an Amazon S3 bucket using the AWS Management Console. I also learned about naming rules, regions, and basic S3 settings like versioning and access permissions.

 What I Did
- Logged into the AWS Console
- Opened the S3 service
- Clicked on “Create bucket”
- Gave the bucket a  name and selected a region
- Left default settings and created the bucket
