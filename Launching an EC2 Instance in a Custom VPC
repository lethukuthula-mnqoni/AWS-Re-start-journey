 Launching an EC2 Instance in a Custom VPC

After completing this lab, I was able to:

- Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- Create subnets within the VPC
- Configure a Security Group
- Launch an Amazon EC2 instance into the VPC

 What I Learned

In this lab, I learned how to manually create a custom VPC environment using the AWS Console. I created subnets, set up networking rules using a security group, and launched an EC2 instance into the VPC. This helped me understand the basic networking structure in AWS.


What I Did Steps 

1. Created a new VPC with a custom IP range (CIDR block)
2. Created two subnets in different availability zones (AZs)
3. Configured a security group to allow SSH (port 22)
4. Launched an EC2 instance and placed it inside one of the custom subnets
5. Verified that the EC2 instance launched successfully and was accessible via SSH
  
This lab was successfully completed after launching the EC2 instance inside the custom VPC and verifying that it was running and accessible.
